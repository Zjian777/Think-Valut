# Some conceptions
 scarcity 
 opportunity cost
 trade-off

# Supply-Demand Model
![[Pasted image 20260120220350.png]]where supply curve and demand curve meets is the **market equilibrium**
positive analysis VS normative analysis

# Preferences and Utility Functions
## Preferences assumptions 
- completeness
- transitivity
- more is better
![[Pasted image 20260120224424.png]]
- comsumers prefer higher indiffernce curves
- indifferences curves never cross
- indifferences curves downward sloping
- ONLY one indifferences curves throwgh one bundle
## Utility Functions
Margin Utility(MU)
The more you have, the less happniness you will derive from the next unit.
![[Pasted image 20260120225712.png]]
Marginal rate substitution (MRS)
$$MRS=\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta C}=-\frac{MU_{C}}{MU_{P}}$$

Indifference curve CANNOT be concave

The curve above violate the principle of margin utility
# Budget Constraint and Constrainted Choices
## Budget constraints
Assumption: 
- Budget =Income,
- no savings and no borrowing
$$Y=Price_{pizza}\times pizza+Price_{cookie}\times cookie$$
where Y denotes the constraints budget
For example, the price of pizza is $12, and the price of cookie is $6.

**Shocking**
- The price of pizza -> $18

**Opportunity Set**

## Constrainted Choice
Assumptions:
$$U=\sqrt{P\times C}$$
where U denotes utility, P denotes pizza and C denotes cookies
![[Pasted image 20260121112809.png]]
Optimal constraints bundles, is the **tangency** of indifference curve and budget line
$$MRS=-\frac{MU_{C}}{MU_{P}}=-\frac{P_{c}}{P_{p}}=MRT$$
